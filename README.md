# hello-world
👋 Hi, I’m @Paul-Greg
👀 I’m interested in training as an application developer to someday get into blockchain development.
🌱 I’m currently learning in the CS50 course and as soon as I finish it I will focus on a bootcamp or course that will help me build my first portfolio.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that helps me to improve, but if it is focused on the blockchain world even better.
📫 How to reach me through my email paulgreg@hotmail.es or through my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-greg-estupinan-rodriguez/.
